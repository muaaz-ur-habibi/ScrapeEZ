<h2>Greetings!</h2>
<p>
  After I built and uploaded my other GUI webscraper, <a href="https://github.com/muaaz-ur-habibi/G-Scraper">G-Scraper</a>, I got quite a few suggestions regarding how to improve it.<br>
  So instead of upgrading it like any normal mentally sane human-being would, I built a seperate project.<br><br>
  BEHOLD, SCRAPEEZ
