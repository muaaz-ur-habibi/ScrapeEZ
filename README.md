<h2>Greetings!</h2>
<p>
  After I built and uploaded my other GUI webscraper, <a href="https://github.com/muaaz-ur-habibi/G-Scraper">G-Scraper</a>, I got quite a few suggestions regarding how to improve it.<br>
  So instead of upgrading it like any normal mentally sane human-being would, I built a seperate project.<br><br>
  BEHOLD, SCRAPEEZ

<h2>Documentation?</h2>
<p>
  Since this is a plusplus version of G-Scraper, most of it is basically the same. So you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/muaaz-ur-habibi/G-Scraper?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use">How to use</a> of G-Scraper<br>
  Moreover, I also made sure to add detailed labels in the app<br>
  But if something is still confusing, you can message me or open an issue
